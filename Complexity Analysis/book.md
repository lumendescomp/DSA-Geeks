O(nlog(n) + mlog(m)) separates the arrays, sorting each based on its own size. This is efficient when one array is much larger than the other, as it minimizes the impact of the larger array's size on the overall sorting time.

O((m+n)log(m+n)) combines the arrays before sorting. This approach treats the combined array as a single entity, which is efficient when the sizes of the arrays are similar, as it leverages the efficiency of sorting a single, larger dataset.
